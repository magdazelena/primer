# Primer docs

## What is Primer

Primer is a template for your private webshop. Backend is created in Strapi, which is an open-source headless CMS. Frontned is Next.js.

## What Primer is not

Primer is not yours to steal and earn money on. Keep that in mind. Primer is to use and share. Primer is a base coat for your own creativity.

## Primer mission

2. Primer is designed with small business owners in mind, especially ones selling unique items, like art, DIY or second-hand goods. You name it.
3. Primer is going to be simple and not bloated with features.
4. Primer is going to be throughly tested and stable.
5. Primer will have CLI for easy implementation on your own custom project.
6. Primer will use ONLY open-source solutions for payments, analytics etc. (some may be payed options of course it wouldn't be sustainable business option).
7. Primer will NOT gather personal data of it's users.
8. Primer is going to be prompt & cookie free.
9. Primer will be yours to take - no requirement for updates, but an option to do so.

This is an open-source side project. It is progressing slowly, and I'm pretty tired ☕️.
